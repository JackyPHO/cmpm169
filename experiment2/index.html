				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I am testing out p5.js to create art designs that utilize animations and vector shapes.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>	Imitate: For the general shape, I took a code snippet that would have a transforming lines of circle that will change based on mouse position. The setup() and draw() were copied from the reference design. <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_0_01">Reference</a><br>
					Integrate: I used a color changing property for shapes that I would add into my transforming circle. The HSB color value changes based on mouse position.<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_1_0_01">Reference</a><br>
					Innovate: For my creativity, I would create disappearing circles from the reference design. A push and pop method from ChatGPT helped with creating multiple instances of the shape will keep the same behaviors of color change and appearance.<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_1_2_01">Reference</a>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was an experiment that I worked on my own. The whole assignment was a new learning experience for me as I was not familiar with p5.js. It was my first time using the editor, but nevertheless, it was cool to create my own kind of graphics. It was interesting to try this new concept of programming where I am working with shapes, colors, animations, etc. For most of the work, I mainly focused on the draw() function that would output my art design. Taking most of the inspiration from the many examples in the Generative Design link. It was just satisfying when many snippets of code are combined to create this original artwork. One moment that worked well was combining the shapes and colors that will change based on mouse position. One challenge of this assignment was the creation of multiple instances of shapes as there werenâ€™t any functions like ellipse() that would be straightforward in creating my shapes. With the help of ChatGPT, I would use the translation approach to create my multiple circle designs for my artwork. Overall, I enjoyed doing this assignment and it was fun to be able to display my art designs onto my webpage.</p>
